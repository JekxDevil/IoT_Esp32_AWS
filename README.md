# IoT_Esp32_AWS
ESP32 connection to AWS services (IoT and Alexa)

# HARDWARE
ESP32 board and BME280/BMP temperature sensor (Alexa isn't requiered)

# SOFTWARE REQUISITES
+ Micropython as supported language for ESP32 (2.15 >= current)
+ IDE - I suggest VSCode and Pymakr extension installed because of the ease of upload entire projects in the board (set extension global settings to the correct port)
+ Linux is suggested because easily manageable and flexible (this guide was developed in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)
